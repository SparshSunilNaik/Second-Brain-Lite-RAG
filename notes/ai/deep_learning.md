# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Introduction

Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These networks can learn hierarchical representations of data, making them particularly powerful for complex tasks.

## Neural Network Basics

A neural network consists of:
- Input layer (receives raw data)
- Hidden layers (process and transform data)
- Output layer (produces predictions)

Each connection between neurons has a weight that gets adjusted during training through backpropagation.

## Why Deep Learning Works

The key insight is that deep networks can learn increasingly abstract representations:
- First layer: edges and simple patterns
- Middle layers: shapes and textures
- Deep layers: high-level concepts

## Applications I'm Interested In

### Computer Vision
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Facial recognition
- Medical image analysis

### Natural Language Processing
- Language translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Text generation (like GPT models)
- Question answering systems

## Challenges

Training deep networks requires:
- Large amounts of labeled data
- Significant computational resources (GPUs)
- Careful hyperparameter tuning
- Techniques to prevent overfitting (dropout, regularization)

## Personal Project Ideas

I want to build a simple image classifier using transfer learning. Starting with a pre-trained model like ResNet and fine-tuning it on a custom dataset seems like a good learning project.

Also interested in exploring attention mechanisms and transformers - they're the foundation of modern NLP.
