# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The core idea is to develop algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model is trained on a dataset where the correct outputs are already known. Common applications include:

- Classification problems (spam detection, image recognition)
- Regression problems (price prediction, weather forecasting)

I've been particularly interested in how supervised learning can be applied to natural language processing tasks.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and relationships in the data without predefined categories. Key techniques include:

- Clustering (customer segmentation, anomaly detection)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

### Reinforcement Learning

This is learning through trial and error. An agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties. I find this fascinating for game AI and robotics applications.

## My Thoughts

Machine learning is transforming every industry. The key challenge isn't just building models, but ensuring they're interpretable, fair, and robust. I need to focus more on understanding the mathematical foundations rather than just using libraries.
