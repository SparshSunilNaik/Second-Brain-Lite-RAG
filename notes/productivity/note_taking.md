# Effective Note-Taking Strategies

## The Zettelkasten Method

I've been experimenting with the Zettelkasten (slip-box) method for organizing knowledge. The key principles are:

1. **Atomic notes**: Each note should contain one idea
2. **Linking**: Connect related notes to build a knowledge network
3. **Own words**: Always rephrase in your own language to ensure understanding
4. **Permanent notes**: Convert fleeting notes into permanent, well-structured ones

This method helps with long-term retention and creative connections between ideas.

## Cornell Note-Taking System

For lectures and meetings, I use the Cornell system:
- Divide page into three sections: notes, cues, summary
- Take notes during the session
- Add cue questions in the left margin
- Write a summary at the bottom

This forces active engagement with the material.

## Digital vs. Analog

I've found that handwriting helps with retention, but digital notes are better for:
- Searchability
- Linking between notes
- Long-term organization
- Backup and sync across devices

My current approach: handwrite during learning, then digitize and expand later.

## Tools I Use

- Obsidian for markdown notes with linking
- Notion for project management and databases
- Physical notebook for quick capture and sketching

## Key Insight

The best note-taking system is the one you actually use consistently. Don't get caught in productivity tool paralysis. Start simple and evolve your system over time.
